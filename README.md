# paseo-playbooks

Paseo plugin that makes an agent pick a playbook and run each step as a subagent, through
to the human gates. See [OVERVIEW.md](OVERVIEW.md) for what it does and
[docs/adrs/2026-11-02-design.md](docs/adrs/2026-11-02-design.md) for the design.

## Layout

| Path | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `index.server.ts`, `server/` | Daemon side: YAML loader and validator, run engine, run store, agent tools, hooks, RPC handlers |
| `index.client.tsx`, `client/` | The Playbooks panel (graph, node sheet, Start form) |
| `shared/` | Zod types, RPC contracts, graph and template helpers |
| `examples/.paseo/plugins/playbooks/` | Example playbooks (PR, Release to dev, and Capability, which combines them as sub-playbooks) and their roles (not loaded by the plugin) |
| `skills/paseo-playbooks/SKILL.md` | Agent skill for writing playbooks; copy or symlink it into a repo's `.agents/skills/` or `.claude/skills/` |

## Develop

```bash
npm install
npm run typecheck
npm test
```

Install on a local daemon from a stable checkout (not a Paseo worktree, which can be
archived), then reload after each change:

```bash
paseo plugin install "$PWD"
paseo plugin reload paseo-playbooks
paseo plugin logs paseo-playbooks
```

To use playbooks in a repository, copy `examples/.paseo/plugins/playbooks/` into it (as
`.paseo/plugins/playbooks/` or `.paseo/playbooks/`),
adjust the roles and playbooks and commit them. Then open the Playbooks panel in a workspace of
that repository and press Start. Start runs the playbook with the workspace's most
recently used agent as manager (see Known limits), in that workspace (the run starts at
once, but if that agent is busy, its kickoff waits until its current turn ends). The arrow
next to Start offers "Start on a new agent", which creates a new manager agent in the same
workspace, and "Start in a new workspace", which creates a new worktree and manager.

## Known limits

- Reloading the plugin (`paseo plugin reload`) removes the playbook tools from agents that
  are already running. They get the tools back when their session restarts.
- If the daemon restarts before a busy agent's queued kickoff is delivered, the kickoff is
  lost (the queue is kept in memory only). The run stays active but nothing drives it.
  Cancel it from the panel and start again.
- Plain Start picks the workspace's most recently used agent (the one you last sent a
  message to, skipping agents that already manage a run), because the panel cannot see
  which tab has focus. To pick a specific agent, send it a message first, or use "Start on
  a new agent".
